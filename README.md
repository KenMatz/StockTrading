Stock Trading
=============

Repository for stock trading algorithm for Bloomberg 2014 Hackathon @ VT.
During the hackathon Bloomberg employee's setup a simulated market
and gave us a API to allow us to make bids and asks on the market.
With no knowledge about finance and the stock market before the hackathon 
I learned a lot and was able to outline a nice trading algorithm to
maximize my total earnings through collecting the highest dividends on 
linearly increasing stocks.

Since the hackathon is over running the trading algorithm by
running the file ```ExecuteCommandsTest.java``` as a junit test will only 
throw exceptions now :)
